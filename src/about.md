Hi! 👋🏽 I'm Andrew, a frontend developer based in Southern California. My coding interests are in modern JavaScript and interactive visual experiences&mdash;namely React, Jamstack, D3, and three.js. Someday I'd like to be fluent with [hydra](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/) and maybe [TidalCycles](http://pages.tidalcycles.org/).

This site is where I [learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/). When I'm trying something new and run into problems, I'll take notes and put my thoughts/solutions in the [blog](/blog/). They won't be one-size-fits-all. But I hope that through here, my new knowledge can go a little further by helping someone else.

## Stuff I like

I love to cook and transcribe/play/write music.

- 🎸 Guitar is my favorite instrument.
- 🍗 I dabble with drums.
- 🎹 I used to play piano a long time ago.
