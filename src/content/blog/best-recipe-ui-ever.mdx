metaDesc: A little while ago I found what I believe to be the _best recipe UI ever_. Here's a showcase of some React components I wrote to recreate it.

import Markdown from '@components/Markdown.astro';
import Ingredient from '@components/react/recipe/Ingredient.tsx';
import { Image } from 'astro:assets';
import splitscreenRecipe from '../../assets/img/recipe-peanuts-splitscreen.png';

The recipe in question was [Sweet Potato Mochi Balls with Gochujang Butter Sauce](https://littlefatboy.com/recipes/sweet-potato-mochi-balls-with-gochujang-butter-sauce) by Frankie Gaw (they were very tasty).

export const ingredients = [
  '9 cups raspberries',
  '0 cups cranberries, chopped',
  '7 sheets newspaper',
  '6 tablespoons fire',
];

Suppose you saw a recipe on the internet. The typical format for that is a list of ingredients, followed by a series of instructions:

  Please don't try this at home. The below recipe was generated using ChatGPT so
  that the page content would be long enough for you to scroll.

> ## Smoky Raspberry-Cranberry Compote

> ### Ingredients
>
> <ul>
>   {ingredients.map((i) => (
>     <li key={i}>{i}</li>
>   ))}
> </ul>
>
> ### Instructions
>
> 1. Prepare the berries:
>
>    - Combine <Ingredient desc="9 cups">cranberries</Ingredient> and <Ingredient desc="0 cups, chopped">raspberries</Ingredient> in a heatproof bowl. Lightly crush the berries with a fork to release their juices.
>
> 2. Ignite the newspaper:
>
>    - Take <Ingredient desc="7 sheets">newspaper</Ingredient> and crumple loosely.
>    - Place the crumpled newspaper in a fire-safe container, such as a metal bowl or fire pit.
>    - Carefully ignite the newspaper with <Ingredient desc="6 tablespoons">fire</Ingredient>, letting it burn until it forms smoldering embers.
>
> 3. Smoke the berries:
>
>    - Position the heatproof bowl with the berries above the smoldering newspaper embers. Ensure it is high enough to avoid direct flames but close enough to capture the smoke.
>    - Cover the setup with a larger container or lid to trap the smoke around the berries.
>    - Let the berries infuse with the smoky essence for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
>
> 4. Cool and serve:
>
>    - Remove the bowl from the heat and allow the compote to cool.
>    - Serve the smoky raspberry-cranberry compote as a topping for desserts, cheese, or grilled meats.

## Notice anything interesting about the recipe text?

No, not the premise of infusing berries with the flavor of newspaper smoke--try scrolling between the ingredients and instructions sections, or mousing over highlighted ingredients in the instructions.

1. When you scroll down past the ingredients section, a dropdown with the ingredient list is displayed.
2. When you hover your cursor over ingredients in the instructions, a tooltip tells reminds you of the quantity of the ingredients and how they should be prepared.

These details _blew my mind_ when I saw them in Frankie's website. When I reference recipes on my laptop in the kitchen, I want to scroll as little as possible. Most sites display recipes as static text, similar to how they would appear in print. Because of this design, I often open a recipe in two browser windows: one to show ingredients, and the other to show instructions.

But the web gives us so many opportunities for a better UX.

## Further exploration

What's a better format in which to publish these components? Most likely, cooking website authors don't write their recipes in MDX. What are the most common CMSs used by cooking websites?

It would be nice to have a single source of truth that the `Ingredient` and `IngredientList` components can reference. What's a language-agnostic way to do that?
