## Background

I recently started buidling a blog for my partner. Based on the features we've decided to include, I've identified this project as a great opportunity to use Next.js for the first time. Even though the the blog has quite a bit of progress to go before it's finished, it's already been a good learning experience.

### What's Next.js?

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a React application framework (or [distro](https://www.swyx.io/react-distros/), if you prefer) which was released in 2016 and sits nicely in the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) world. It provides abstractions for building websites with React[\*](#dont-need-react-in-built-site) that can use pre-rendered with <abbr title="static site generation">SSG</abbr>, <abbr title="server-side rendering">SSR</abbr>, or a mix of the two. Like React itself, Next.js is unopinionated about styling or state management.

<aside id="dont-need-react-in-built-site">

Interestingly, you can [disable client-side JavaScript](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/11949#issuecomment-619363165) when building a Next.js site to deliver smaller, more performant websites while still being able to statically generate or server-side render pages.

</aside>

The momentum behind Next.js on a community-building level is super impressive. For instance, Vercel, the company which owns and primarily develops Next.js, has [worked with the Google Chrome team on image optimization](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-10#nextjs-image-component) and has [hired the author of webpack](https://twitter.com/wSokra/status/1381860800533528576). Suffice to say, Next.js is a tool worth keeping an eye out for&mdash;and in my opinion, one worth learning.

I’ve been following developers who make/use Next.js on Twitter for about a year. It’s very cool to see that the framework can create sophisticated sites while maintaining an excellent developer experience with features like fast refresh and automatic code splitting. In addition to its production use in sites for big names including [GitHub, Nike, and Square Enix](https://twitter.com/rauchg/status/1359237922076037122?s=20); here are some Next.js sites that stand out to me:

- [GeoGuessr](https://www.geoguessr.com/), a game where you guess where in the world you are, based on a random Google Street View
- [istheshipstillstuck.com](https://istheshipstillstuck.com/), a live-updating static page to show the status of the March 2021 Suez Canal obstruction, which [scaled to handle traffic in the millions](https://twitter.com/rauchg/status/1376266818420056066)
- [Pinecraft](https://pinecraft.sennep.com/), a digital lathe app by a studio which plants a real tree for every tree you carve/paint
- [next-adventure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qkoAPRG2wY), a choose-your-own-adventure game with dynamic routing based on your story choices

Each Next.js page is a React component which lives in its own file in the project's `pages` directory. For example, an about page might look like this:

```jsx
// pages/about.js

export default function About() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>The inner machinations of my mind are an enigma.</p>
    </main>
  );
}
```

This concept of pages as components allows you to create new pages with little effort while leveraging React's flexibility and scalability. It also allows you to automatically generate pages with dynamic routes.

### What's dynamic routing?

Dynamic routing refers to generating routes (URLs) to serve individual pages based on data which is subject to change.

Let's say we're making a blog using any old static site generator. The following data for our blog posts lives on a <abbr title="content management system">CMS</abbr> which is queried by our static site generator at build time:

```json
[
  {
    "Id": 0,
    "Slug": "my-first-post",
    "Title": "My First Post",
    "Text": "People talk loud when they wanna act smart, right?"
  },
  {
    "Id": 1,
    "Slug": "another-post",
    "Title": "Another Post",
    "Text": "It's not just a boulder... It's a rock!"
  }
]
```

After our blog is built, we want to be able to access pages for each of these posts based on their slugs, i.e., [https://our.blog/post/my-first-post](#) and [https://our.blog/post/another-post](#). We also want to do this without having to manually write a file like `post/my-first-post/index.html`&mdash;a process which would get _very_ tedious with dozens or hundreds of posts. This is where static site generators shine!

Let's say we add a new post:

```json
[
  ...
  {
    Id: 2,
    Slug: "the-newest-post",
    Title: "The Newest Post",
    Text: "Can't have dirty garbage!"
  }
]
```

With dynamic routing, we want to automatically create a new page, [https://our.blog/post/the-newest-post](#), when this post is added.

### How does Next.js handle dynamic routing?

In Next.js, generating blog post pages based on JSON data is done by creating a page with a special filename, and implementing two functions: `getStaticProps` and `getStaticPaths`. These functions are the secret sauce behind how Next.js statically generates a bunch of pages.

I first tried to learn about them by reading Next.js' docs. I didn't really understand what I read, because I didn't have any live code samples to examine and tinker with.[\*](#learn-nextjs) I thought, maybe I can just make and break stuff until I see how these functions work together.

## Let's make a basic blog

I got started on this project by following along with [Chris Sev's tutorial on how to make a blog with Strapi and Next.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrmndNpWSJw). Over the course of an hour, Chris demonstrates how to set up a database and API endpoints to store blog posts with the [Strapi CMS](https://strapi.io/), and how to retrieve and render those blog posts with Next.js.

For this toy example, let's make the following assumptions:

1. The body of each blog post is just a single paragraph. It's fairly straightforward to store post content as Markdown and [transform the Markdown into HTML](https://nextjs.org/blog/markdown), but that's outside of the scope of this blog post.
1. I'm modeling the example API endpoints/responses off of the ones provided by Strapi.
1. Posts are served at the `post/` subdirectory.

After following along with Chris' tutorial, I had a homepage plus a page for each post, like this:

<iframe
  src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/nextjs-dynamic-routing-posts-isfrx?module=/pages/index.js,/pages/post/[slug].js&view=split&fontsize=12&theme=dark"
  style="width:100%; height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;"
  title="nextjs-dynamic-routing-posts-isfrx"
  allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
  sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
></iframe>

Let's see how those blog post pages are implemented.[\*](#codesandbox-differences)

<aside id="codesandbox-differences">

If you inspect the CodeSandbox above, you'll notice that the blog posts are hardcoded, rather than coming from an API, as I'm explaining below. The blog posts are hardcoded in the CodeSandbox just for illustrative purposes. You're more likely to use the API version in production.

It would have been nice to showcase [Next.js' API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) for this, but [you can't use API routes in `getStaticProps` or `getStaticPaths`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62089870/api-call-in-nextjs-getstaticprops-causes-error-500/62091147#62091147). I also tried setting `process.env.BLOG_API_ENDPOINT` to point to the absolute URL of the CodeSandbox, but I couldn't fix the CORS errors that that caused.

</aside>

### Blog post page implementation

As I stated earlier, dynamically rendering blog posts is done by implementing the `getStaticProps` and `getStaticPaths` functions in a page file with a special name. If you'll bear with me, I'll work backwards and wait to give definitions for these functions until we see how they interact with each other.

This is more or less what the code for my blog post page looked like after completing that tutorial:

```jsx
// post/[slug].js

export default function Post({ post }) {
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{post.Title}</h1>
      <p>{post.Text}</p>
    </article>
  );
}

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const res = await fetch(`${process.env.BLOG_API_ENDPOINT}/posts`);
  const posts = await res.json();

  const paths = posts.map((post) => ({
    params: { slug: post.Slug },
  }));

  return {
    paths,
    fallback: false,
  };
}

export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  const { slug } = params;

  const res = await fetch(
    `${process.env.BLOG_API_ENDPOINT}/posts?Slug=${slug}`
  );
  const data = await res.json();
  const post = data[0];

  return {
    props: { post },
  };
}
```

There's a lot going on here, so let's break it down:

#### Page component definition

```jsx
export default function Post({ post }) {
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{post.Title}</h1>
      <p>{post.Text}</p>
    </article>
  );
}
```

Like the `About` component above, `Post` is a function which returns a page. The text content of this page is determined by the `post` property of the object that `Post` receives as a prop.

Where does that prop come from?

#### `getStaticProps`

```jsx
export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  const { slug } = params;

  const res = await fetch(
    `${process.env.BLOG_API_ENDPOINT}/posts?Slug=${slug}`
  );
  const data = await res.json();
  const post = data[0];

  return {
    props: { post },
  };
}
```

`getStaticProps` returns an object with a `props` key, whose value becomes the prop object for the `Post` component.

In this case, `getStaticProps` makes an async API request to grab a post with a particular slug. The slug we want is determined by the `params` property of the object that `getStaticProps` receives as an argument.

Likewise, that argument object containing `params` has to come from somewhere too.

#### `getStaticPaths`

```jsx
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const res = await fetch(`${process.env.BLOG_API_ENDPOINT}/posts`);
  const posts = await res.json();

  const paths = posts.map((post) => ({
    params: { slug: post.Slug },
  }));

  return {
    paths,
    fallback: false,
  };
}
```

That somewhere is `getStaticPaths`, which returns an object with two properties:

1. `paths` - An array of objects which each have a `params` key
1. `fallback` - A boolean that indicates whether a fallback page has been defined. Since it's set to `false` here, trying to navigate to any page that's not included in `paths` (for example, [https://our.blog/post/blargen-fezibble-nohip](#)) will result in a 404 response.

Note that in this example, the shape and size of `paths` correspond to the list of all blog posts that our API gives us.

#### Filename

```jsx
// post/[slug].js
```

Last but not least, it's crucial that:

1. The location of this file corresponds to what we want the page's URL to look like, i.e., it's in the correct directory in our project. Since we want to serve posts from the `post/` subdirectory of the built site, this file must be placed in a project folder that's also called `post/`.
1. The file's name is the page's dynamic route parameter (in this case, `slug`, which is defined in each object in the `paths` array of `getStaticPaths`), wrapped in square brackets.

### Adding categories

Now we're getting to why I decided to write this blog post.

I encountered a fun learning opportunity in the blog I'm making because it's really going to be several blogs in one, separated by category. These categories are kind of like tags commonly seen in blogs, except that each post belongs to exactly one category.

In Strapi, this is done by creating a new collection for categories, then setting up a one-to-many mapping between categories and posts.

With our three blog posts, let's say one category contains two posts, and the other category contains the remaining post. So this is what the category collection looks like:

```json
[
  {
    Id: "a",
    Slug: "alpha",
    Name: "Alpha",
    posts: [
      {
        Id: 0,
        ...
      },
      {
        Id: 1,
        ...
      },
    ]
  },
  {
    Id: "g",
    Slug: "gold",
    Name: "Gold",
    posts: [
      {
        Id: 2,
        ...
      },
    ]
  }
]
```

Now, when we fetch blog posts, the data we receive looks like this:

{/* TODO highlight 6-9,16-19,26-29 */}

```json
[
  {
    Id: 0,
    Slug: "my-first-post",
    Title: "My First Post",
    Text: "People talk loud when they wanna act smart, right?"
    category: {
      Id: "a",
      ...
    }
  },
  {
    Id: 1,
    Slug: "another-post",
    Title: "Another Post",
    Text: "It's not just a boulder... It's a rock!",
    category: {
      Id: "a",
      ...
    }
  },
  {
    Id: 2,
    Slug: "the-newest-post",
    Title: "The Newest Post",
    Text: "Can't have dirty garbage!",
    category: {
      Id: "g",
      ...
    }
  }
]
```

#### Category page implementation

This is where the docs and tutorials ended. Seeing as there's no page in the Next.js docs about adding category pages for blog posts, I winged creating a new file to dynamically generate category pages, by duplicating and modifying `post/[slug].js`.

Writing the new page for categories wasn't too hard, but _naming_ it was. Initially I had posts served from the root directory, like [https://our.blog/my-first-post](#). I wanted to serve categories from the root directory instead, like [https://our.blog/gold](#). This caused a conflict, since the slug property for both posts and categories is called `slug`&mdash;you can't have two files in the same directory named `[slug].js`! This is why I moved posts to the `post/` subdirectory. Plus I figured that having `/post/` in a post's URL would make that URL easier to read when shared.

Also, Next.js will tell you if the statically generated page's filename isn't right. If we change the filename to `[wumbo].js`, we get this error in the browser:

```
Server Error
Error: A required parameter (wumbo) was not provided as a string in getStaticPaths for /[wumbo]
```

The bracketed filename determines what property Next.js looks for when statically generating pages. That is, this file's pages will fail to build if the objects in the `paths` array returned by `getStaticPaths` do not contain the bracketed word.

Next.js' error messages made these errors clear and quick to diagnose. After working around them, I was pleasantly surprised to arrive at this implementation of category pages in what seemed like no time at all:

<iframe
  src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/nextjs-dynamic-routing-categories-mxt6p?module=/pages/index.js,/pages/[slug].js,/pages/post/[slug].js&view=split&fontsize=12&theme=dark"
  style="width:100%; height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;"
  title="nextjs-dynamic-routing-categories-mxt6p"
  allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
  sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
></iframe>

Seeing that this thing I hacked together _just worked_ put a huge grin on my face. It was like magic.

## Summary

After writing the above implementation, I ended up with this understanding of Next.js' SSG functions:

### What does `getStaticProps` do?

`getStaticProps` defines the props that a statically generated page will receive.

### What does `getStaticPaths` do?

`getStaticPaths` defines **which** and **how many** pages will be statically generated at build time.

I was delighted to reread Next.js' docs at this point and find that what they said about [`getStaticProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticprops-static-generation) and [`getStaticPaths`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticpaths-static-generation) actually made sense to me, because it matched my own newly acquired comprehension.

<aside id="learn-nextjs">

<p>
  I found out only later that [Learn
  Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app") contains thorough
  guides on how
  [`getStaticProps`](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/data-fetching/with-data)
  and
  [`getStaticPaths`](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/dynamic-routes/page-path-external-data)
  work. I'd known that this resource existed and was probably very good, but I
  skipped it because I was impatient to get started on this project. <Shrug />
</p>

Learn Next.js contains a lot of detail and diagrams, and is probably where you should start learning about these functions if stumbling into answers isn't your style.

</aside>

## The big picture

This is a rather specific example of dynamic routing. And React-based static site generation is arguably overkill for a simple blog. But I think I can use lessons from this to apply to other situations. Maybe you can too!

At first, I didn't quite get how Next.js could fit into [ecommerce sites](https://nextjs.org/commerce). After figuring out this whole category pages thing, it clicked and I thought, of course Next.js can do ecommerce. Easily. For example, you can can define a route, `product/[id].js`, to generate a page for every single product in your catalog database. It's amazing to me that process can be orchestrated in JavaScript.

So Next.js’ secret sauce is not dynamic routing itself, but great API design. I've heard that one of Next.js' best features is how its conventions allow developers who are unfamiliar with it to quickly become productive with it.

Also, this was a learning moment that made me feel knowledgeable and capable about JavaScript and React. As an early-career developer with plenty of impostor syndrome, that's kind of a big deal. It reminded me of why I enjoy programming in the first place!
