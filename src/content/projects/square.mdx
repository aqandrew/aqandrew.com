As a design technologist at Square, I was a frontend developer who sat among designers, responsible for writing custom styles on [squareup.com](https://squareup.com/) that deviate from Market, Square's design system for public webpages. These custom styles included responsive flex/grid layouts, animations, and interactive Svelte components.

## Virtual Terminal

Usually custom styles were limited to 1-2 sections per page, but Virtual Terminal had custom styles in almost every section--the most out of any Square webpage I worked on.

Several of the sections mainly relied on CSS grid layouts:

1. ### side-scrolling modals

   <LightboxGallery
     client:load
     images={BREAKPOINTS.map(({ label, desc }) => ({
       src:
         IMG_PATH +
         'squareup.com_us_en_payments_virtual-terminal_ssm_' +
         label +
         '.png',
       alt: `Virtual Terminal side-scrolling modal grid - ${desc}`,
     }))}
   />

   For the section showcasing how to use Virtual Terminal on different platforms, I used CSS grids to lay out both the tiles that open the modals, as well as the columns of images/copy inside each modal.

   For these particular modals, I extended Market's modal component to redirect vertical scrolling into horizontal scrolling, with a progress indicator.

   <video controls autoPlay loop className="rounded">
     <source
       src={`${IMG_PATH}squareup.com_us_en_payments_virtual-terminal_ssm.mov`}
     />
   </video>

2. ### feature modals

   <LightboxGallery
     client:load
     images={BREAKPOINTS.map(({ label, desc }) => ({
       src:
         IMG_PATH +
         'squareup.com_us_en_payments_virtual-terminal_mt_' +
         label +
         '.png',
       alt: `Virtual Terminal feature modals - ${desc}`,
     }))}
   />

3. ### pricing section

   <LightboxGallery
     client:load
     images={BREAKPOINTS.map(({ label, desc }) => ({
       src:
         IMG_PATH +
         'squareup.com_us_en_payments_virtual-terminal_pricing_' +
         label +
         '.png',
       alt: `Virtual Terminal pricing section - ${desc}`,
     }))}
   />

### comparison table with highlighted column

The design of this table called for highlighting the Virtual Terminal column in blue and giving it rounded corners. While CSS grid provides simple methods for that, the fact the table was rendered from Markdown meant that this was a case best suited for a plain old HTML `table`. I wrote a reusable SCSS mixin to highlight a `table` column, that takes a column number as a parameter. A fun little challenge in writing the mixin was that our default table styles included borders.

<Image
  src={vtComparisonTable}
  alt="Table showing Square Virtual Terminal's offerings highlighted, compared to other payment processors and banks. $0 monthly fee, no monthly contracts, free sales reports and insights, and free customer engagement tools."
/>

To keep the translation/localization process simple, we generally wanted to author webpages' copy in Markdown as much as possible. We were able to keep this experience for the table shown on mobile devices by nesting separate Markdown tables in a Market tabbed content section.

<video controls autoPlay loop className="rounded mobile">
  <source
    src={`${IMG_PATH}squareup.com_us_en_payments_virtual-terminal_why-square_sm.mov`}
  />
</video>

### fading in content

I also set up an `IntersectionObserver` to fade in content as the user scrolls down the page.

## Seller stories

I wrote reusable CSS utilities for testimonials / case studies from Square sellers, and applied them to pages for multiple locales including en-US, es-US, en-GB, en-IE, es-ES, and ca-ES.

<LightboxGallery
  client:load
  images={[
    {
      name: 'squareup.com_us_en_point-of-sale_learn_aroom.png',
      alt: 'Aroom seller story (en-US)',
    },
    {
      name: 'squareup.com_us_es_point-of-sale_learn_la-barba.png',
      alt: 'La Barba seller story (es-US)',
    },
    {
      name: 'squareup.com_gb_en_point-of-sale_learn_soho-live-music-club.png',
      alt: 'Soho Live seller story (en-GB)',
    },
    {
      name: 'squareup.com_ie_en_point-of-sale_learn_artybaker.png',
      alt: 'Artybaker seller story (en-IE)',
    },
    {
      name: 'squareup.com_es_es_point-of-sale_learn_mito.png',
      alt: 'Mito (es-ES)',
    },
  ].map(({ name, alt }) => ({ src: IMG_PATH + name, alt }))}
/>

My favorite piece was the component below, which places quoted text with a solid white background in the corner of an image. It uses radial gradients, clipping masks, and CSS variables to create a silhouette with smooth rounded corners that change size with the user's viewport.

Displaying the quote text as HTML elements (instead of embedding it in each image) kept the text accessible and responsive, and saved production designers from having to do extra work.

<Image
  src={quoteArtybakerMd}
  alt="Quote component from Artybaker seller story page (tablet screen size), with text in the upper right corner and a large border radius"
/>

<Image
  src={quoteMitoLg}
  alt="Quote component from Mito seller story page (small desktop screen size), with text in the lower right corner and a small border radius"
/>

## Marketing

I created a custom Svelte component to animate in the presence of example UI elements on top of this page's hero image.

<video controls autoPlay loop className="rounded">
  <source src={IMG_PATH + 'squareup.com_us_en_marketing_hero-animation.mov'} />
</video>

The original animations both fade in and slide upward, which might cause discomfort for people with vestibular disorders. To help make the animation more accessible, its behavior changes to a simple fade-in if the user's settings prefer reduced motion.

<video controls autoPlay loop className="rounded">
  <source
    src={
      IMG_PATH +
      'squareup.com_us_en_marketing_hero-animation_prefers-reduced-motion.mov'
    }
  />
</video>

These are just a few examples TODO.
