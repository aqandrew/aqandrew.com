As a design technologist at Square, I was a frontend developer who sat among designers, responsible for writing custom styles on [squareup.com](https://squareup.com/) that deviate from Square's design system for public webpages. These custom styles included responsive flex/grid layouts, animations, and interactive Svelte components.

## Virtual Terminal

This page had the most custom styles out of any Square webpage I worked on. Several of these sections mainly relied on CSS grid layouts:

### side-scrolling modals

These were particularly challenging because TODO

<video controls>
  <source
    src={`${IMG_PATH}squareup.com_us_en_payments_virtual-terminal_ssm.mov`}
  />
</video>

<LightboxGallery
  client:load
  images={BREAKPOINTS.map(({ label, desc }) => ({
    src:
      IMG_PATH +
      'squareup.com_us_en_payments_virtual-terminal_ssm_' +
      label +
      '.png',
    alt: `Virtual Terminal side-scrolling modal grid - ${desc}`,
  }))}
/>

### modal tiles

### testimonial carousel

### table with highlighted column, accomplished with box-shadow

TODO

### pricing grid

TODO

I also set up an `IntersectionObserver` to fade in content as the user scrolls down the page.

## Seller stories

I wrote reusable CSS utilities for Square seller testimonials and case studies. My favorite piece was this component that places a caption over the corner of an image. It uses radial gradients, clipping masks, and CSS variables to create a silhouette with smooth rounded corners that change size with the user's viewport.

TODO

## Marketing

I created a custom Svelte component to animate in the presence of example UI elements on top of this page's hero image.

To help make the animation more accessible, its behavior changes to a simple fade-in if the user's settings prefer reduced motion.

## Bakery

Responsive CSS grid layout for pricing cards.
