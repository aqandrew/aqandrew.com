Hi! My name's

# Andrew Aquino.

I'm a frontend developer in Southern California. These are my projects and notes about **JavaScript**, **CSS**, **design**, and **anything else I'm learning**.

---

<mark>**I'm actively seeking a remote frontend developer role.**</mark> I like to create beautifulÂ user-friendly software and grow my frontend skillset. Most of my professional experience so far has been with Angular and Node.js, with a bit of UX design thrown in. I've been teaching myself React recently, but I'm happy to learn whatever technology gets the job done.

Interested? [&#8594; Let's talk.](mailto:hi@aqandrew.com)
