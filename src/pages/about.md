Thank you for visiting my website. 🌞 This is where I [learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/). When I'm trying something new and run into problems, I'll take notes and put my thoughts/solutions in the [blog](/blog/) for future reference.

## Me

I love to cook and transcribe/play/write music.

- 🎸 Guitar is my favorite instrument.
- 🇵🇭 I'm learning [octavina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octavina) in a rondalla, a Filipino string ensemble.
- 🍗 I dabble with drums.
- 🎹 I started on piano when I was little, and picked it back up during the pandemic.

I also enjoy some creative coding outside of work. Someday I'd like to be fluent with live coding environments like [hydra](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/) and maybe [TidalCycles](http://pages.tidalcycles.org/).
